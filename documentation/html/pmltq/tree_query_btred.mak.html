<body><h1>Generated documentation for pmltq/tree_query_btred.mak</h1>
<div class="pod">
<p>1. find in the query graph an oriented sceleton tree, possibly using
Kruskal and some weighting rules favoring easy to follow types of
edges (relations) with minimum number of potential target nodes
(e.g. parent, ancestor a/lex.rf are better than child, descendant or
a/aux.rf, and far better then their negated counterparts).</p>
<p>2. Order sibling nodes of this tree by similar algorithm so that all
relations between these nodes go from right bottom to left top (using
reversing where possible) and the result is near optimal using similar
weighting as above. This may be done only for relations not occuring
in condition formulas.</p>
<p>3. For each relation between nodes that occurs in a condition formula,
assume that the relation is or is not satisfied so that the truth
value of the condition is not decreased (whether to take the formula
negatively or positively is probably easy to compute since we may
eliminate all negations of non-atomic subformulas and then aim for
TRUE value of the respective literal; that is, we only count the
number of negations on the path from the root of the expression to the
predicate representing the relational constraint and assume TRUE for
even numbers and FALSE for odd numbers).</p>
<p>The actual truth values of these relations will be verified only after
all query nodes have been matched (or maybe for each node as soon as
all nodes it refers to have been matched).</p>
<p>4. The query context consists of:</p>
<p>- the node in the query-tree being matched (current query node)</p>
<p>- association of the previously matched query nodes with result node iterators</p>
<p>- information about unresolved relational constraints on already
  matched nodes</p>
<p>5. the search starts by creating an initial query context and a simple
iterator for the root query node matches</p>
<p>6. in each step one of the following cases occurs:</p>
<p>- the iterator for the current query node is empty
  -&gt; backtrack: return to the state of the context of the previous query node
     and iterate the associated iterator
  -&gt; fail if there is no previous query node</p>
<p>- the iterator returns a node:</p>
<pre>  - check relational constraints depending on this node.
    If any of them invalidates the condition on an already matched node,
    itereate and repeat 6

  - if there is a following query node, make it the current query node
    and repeat 6

  - otherwise: we have a complete match. Return the match, back-track
    the context to the root-node and iterate the root-node iterator.
    Then repeat 6.

</pre>
<p>Note: #occurrences are to be implemented as sub-queries that are
processed along with other conditions within the simple iterators.
The relation predicates from these sub-queries to the out-side trees
are treated as predicate relations in complex relations and are only
resolved as soon as all required query nodes are matched.</p>
